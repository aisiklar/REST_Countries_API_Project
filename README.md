## My process

### Built with

- React.js, React-Router (see note), Context
- vite.js for scaffolding the project and bundling
- Styling
  - CSS, SASS
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
  - icons from [Material UI](http:www.mui.com) 
- important libraries
  - react-select

note: React-Router is used but it was not out of necessity, but mainly to learn about it. However in future, an additional route will be added. 

### What I learned

important new skills I learned:
  - react router
  - react context
  - using libraries like react-select, MUI icons etc.
Additionally
- wrote many logic scripts with JS, improving my skills in JS, especially async functions.
- improved react.js skills a lot.
- improved CSS and learned SASS


### Continued development
- plan to add a new route use use react-route more effectively (though the project does not require)
- there is a slight styling issue with the react-select comp. Wish to revisit later.
